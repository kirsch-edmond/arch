                <div>
                    <p>In 2019 , when I started practicing this beautiful craft of architecture , I wanted to 
                        connect with like-minded individuals . So i joined some facebook groups centered on 
                        architecture . I was pretty disappointed . All i saw was people screaming 
                        [ metaphorically ] ,"Buy from me ! Buy from me! I have the best designs !" etc .</p>
                    <p>To be honest I also did some of that . It didn't work . And now I know for a fact that I 
                        annoyed a lot of people .</p>
                    <p>But then I wondered why . And it dawned to me that people want to be served what they 
                        want , when they want and how they want. 
                        </p>
                    <p>Guess what I started getting clients . People who trusted me enough to give me a try . 
                        People who liked my work enough to recommend me to their peers . And most 
                        importantly , People I Served . </p>
                    <p>That is why I creaed this ebook to share with people what to know when choosing a 
                        modern house plan .
                        </p>
                    <p>Note : I'm not giving you architectural training . Don' t go around telling your friends you 
                        can design their building for them . Let a professional ,like me , do the work for you .</p>

                <h3>These Are Some Tips I Shared With My Clients To Help <br>Them Get The Building plan Of 
                    their Choice .</h3>

                <p>You see if you want to build a modern house , you really have to know your budget . I'll 
                    assume you have a site plan and indenture for your land . If you don't you have to get a 
                    qualified surveyor to do that for you .</p>
                <p>Now , back to the budget , do not even attempt to start a building you know you can't 
                    finish . It makes the area look bad, It is a souce of regret , and overall it leaves you very
                    dissatified .</p>
                <p>Second thing is know what you want . Let me take you back to school . Remember the 5 
                    W's . Who , What, Which, Where and Why . Let me introduce you to the 5 W's of 
                    building . This is a concept I've made through my experience . </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><i class="fa-solid fa-square-check"></i>Who : who are you building it for ? Is it for your mother ? Father ? Yourself ?
